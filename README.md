This tool was created as a freetime tool. Its purpose is to take a $R^1$ function as a string and calculate the analytic derivative, simplifying the terms.

Currently, the expression needs to be specified in the main-method. There are a few examples to show how it works.

Currently supported functions:
- Addition
- Multiplication
- Power
- Symbol (e.g. 'x')
- Unary minus
- Logarithm

The simplification works in general, it though it is far from perfect.
